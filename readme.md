# Oculomotor trajectory mapping on body as an effective intervention to enhance attention

This code is used to replicate the results, analysis and figures in the paper named "Oculomotor trajectory mapping on body as an effective intervention to enhance attention". 

## File Structure

- figure.py: data preprocess, analysis and figure plot.
- utils.py: functions used in figure.py
- dataset folder: raw dataset and processed dataset
- EyeTrackingMetrics folder: This folder comes from the open-source library (https://github.com/Husseinjd/EyeTrackingMetrics). We use it to calculate the gaze stationary entropy.

## Steps to Replicate the Results and Figures in the Paper

- Download gaze data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nFU209As_d3IHG9erc7IfIu_Bdjwd-7/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOsSbQPnWU-mQOlOUGsJ5Da9KZu0t2ZO/view?usp=sharing) and put them into the dataset folder.

- Run the code block one by one in order to process the raw dataset and plot figures.
