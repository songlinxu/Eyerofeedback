## File Structure

- figure.py: data preprocess, analysis and figure plot.
- utils.py: functions used in figure.py
- dataset folder: raw dataset and processed dataset
- EyeTrackingMetrics folder: This folder comes from the open-source library (https://github.com/Husseinjd/EyeTrackingMetrics). We use it to calculate the gaze stationary entropy.
